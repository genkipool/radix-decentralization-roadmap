# Scope

**Goal.** The Radix Babylon network should serve **any user, in any use case**, without depending on the Babylon Network Gateway: the REST + DataAggregator + PostgreSQL service published today at `mainnet.radixdlt.com`. The use cases are:

- wallets;
- dApps;
- ROLA login;
- transaction explorers;
- governance;
- agents;
- developer tools.

**Design principle: everything on Layer 1.** Radix's goal is to scale and deliver all its features on Layer 1, without Layer-2 solutions (rollups, sidechains or partner chains). Every proposal in this report respects that principle:

- The light indexer, read nodes and access-point discovery are infrastructure for **reading** Layer-1 state. They do not execute transactions or keep any state of their own that the network has to trust.
- Pruning, verified snapshots, the migration to Rust and verifiable reads are changes to Layer-1 node software.
- Incentives for serving reads would be paid on Layer 1 itself (for example, through an on-ledger component), as governance decides.
- Hyperscale scales **on Layer 1 itself**, through sharding with atomic composability, which is consistent with that goal.
- The bridge in strategy M2 (chapter [11](11-hyperscale-evolution.md#s11)) would only connect two Layer-1 networks during the transition, and it is optional.

References to Layer-2 or partner-chain mechanisms in other networks (chapter [12](12-references-other-networks.md#s12)) are included only as a contrast, not as a model.

# 1. Current situation: data

<a id="s1-1"></a>

## 1.1 The Gateway and its funding

| Data point | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Gateway database size (Feb 2026) | **~2 TB, growing ~60 GB/month** | Foundation RFP, 3 Feb 2026 |
| Estimated size today (Nov 2026) | ~2.5 TB (2 TB + 9 months × 60 GB) | calculation |
| RFP requirements | 99.9 % uptime, <1 s latency, blue/green deployment | RFP |
| DataAggregator | **Single instance**: transactions are processed sequentially | Foundation, radixtalk 2202 posts 15 and 22 |
| Current operator | Former Foundation DevOps team, as a standalone operation | Blog, 28 Apr 2026 |
| Funding | **Until end of December 2026** | Blog, 28 Apr 2026 |
| Cost for a third party | ~€300-400/month for the Gateway alone; ~€500/month including relay and signalling | Community proposal, radixtalk 2202 post 26 |
| Estimated load | ~250,000 requests/hour (~69 req/s) | Community estimate, radixtalk 2202 post 29 |
| Xi'an / Hyperscale | "would require building a completely new gateway"; the current one is not reusable | Foundation, radixtalk 2202 post 15 |
| WebRTC signalling | ~6,000 concurrent peak connections | RFP |

<a id="s1-2"></a>

## 1.2 Mainnet measurements for this report (3 Nov 2026, via the public API)

| Measure | Value |
|---|---|
| Current `state_version` | 567,005,616 (epoch 355,117) |
| State-version rate | **~3.6/s on average** since June 2026 (4.4/s in today's sample). Each consensus round is one version. |
| User transactions per day (100-transaction sample at each date) | Nov 2023: 1.5k · Mar 2024: 5.5k · Jul 2024: 11.6k · Nov 2024: 20.7k · **Mar 2025: 34.7k (peak)** · Jul 2025: 8.4k · Nov 2025: 5.9k · Mar 2026: 3.4k · Jul 2026: 2.2k · Oct 2026: 4.4k |
| Estimated user transactions since genesis | **~10-15 million** (rough integration, ±50 %) |
| Share of user transactions | **~2-3 % of state versions** over the whole history (~10-15 million of ~567 million); today, under 1 %. The rest (~97-98 %) are round and epoch changes. |
| Node historical window | `state_version_history_length = 60000` versions by default, **≈ 4-5 hours** at the average of 3.6 versions/s (≈ 3.8 h at today's measured rate) |

**Key consequence.** Most of the Gateway's volume probably comes from storing the full history of every substate, including ~555 million round updates. (This is an inference: the composition of its database has not been published.) An index that records only what clients need deals with ~10-15 million user transactions. That is a problem **about 40-55 times smaller**.

<a id="s1-3"></a>

## 1.3 What real queries to the Gateway show (3 Nov 2026)

To better understand what the Gateway does and what would have to be replaced, its public API was queried:

| Query | Result | What it implies |
|---|---|---|
| State of the XRD resource at version 10,000 (`at_ledger_state`, 28 Sep 2023) | It answers: total supply of 12,660,434,555 XRD then, versus 13,565,348,962 today | The Gateway serves **full history from genesis**. The node only keeps a few hours (section [3.1](03-what-the-node-offers.md#s3-1)). That arbitrary history is what takes most space and what the light indexer does not replicate; whoever needs it would run an archive node (sections [6.2](06-recommended-solution.md#s6-2) and [9.6](09-lighter-nodes.md#s9-6)). |
| XRD holders (`/extensions/resource-holders/page`) | `total_count`: **435,605** | It gives the order of magnitude of the holder index (h). At ~100 bytes per row (an assumption), XRD would take about 44 MB: a tiny fraction of the light indexer's estimated total (10-50 GB). |
| Response headers | `server: cloudflare`, `cf-cache-status: DYNAMIC` | The public Gateway sits behind Cloudflare and its responses are not served from cache. It is another central dependency; read nodes need their own protection against attacks (N6). |
| `/status/gateway-status` and `/status/network-configuration` | Version 1.10.6 (image v1.10.7); network `mainnet`, id 1 and well-known addresses | The light indexer can obtain the same data from the node (`/status/network-configuration`). |

**Conclusion:** the Gateway's functions fall into three groups, and all three have a replacement:

1. current state → the node itself;
2. indexes (per-entity history, holders, NFT location, search) → the light indexer;
3. arbitrary historical state → archive nodes, only for those who need it.

That is why the Gateway **can be removed completely**.

# 2. Who depends on the Gateway, and for what

| Client | Gateway endpoints | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Sargon** (Rust core shared by iOS and Android) | `transaction/{construction, preview, preview-v2, submit, status, subintent-status}`, `status/gateway-status`, `state/entity/details`, `state/entity/page/{fungibles, non-fungibles, non-fungible-vaults, non-fungible-vault/ids}`, `state/account/page/{resource-preferences, authorized-depositors}`, `state/non-fungible/{location, data}`, `extensions/entities-by-role-requirement/lookup` | Transaction review and fees, submit and track, pre-authorisations, securified or deleted accounts, MFA and shields, account deletion, RNS, NFT pricing |
| **Android wallet** (Kotlin, on top of Sargon) | `state/entity/details`, `state/entity/page/{fungibles, non-fungibles, non-fungible-vault/ids, metadata}`, `state/non-fungible/data`, `state/account-lockers/touched-at`, `state/account-locker/page/vaults`, `transaction/{construction, account-deposit-pre-validation}`, `stream/transactions`, `status/gateway-status` | Balances, NFTs, pools, validators, LSUs, stake claims, dApp metadata, account recovery, lockers, deposit pre-validation, **history** |
| **iOS wallet** (Swift, on top of Sargon) | Same, plus `state/entity/page/fungible-vaults` | Same |
| **Radix dApp Toolkit** | `transaction/status`, `transaction/subintent-status`, `state/entity/page/metadata` | Track the transaction the wallet submits; dApp name on the connect button |
| **ROLA** (`radixdlt/rola`) | `state/entity/details` (`owner_keys` metadata) | **Sign-in for every dApp.** It is queried on every sign-in (`typescript/src/rola.ts:49-87`, `gateway.ts:14-38`) and uses the public URL by default. |
| **Connector Extension** | `transaction/status` (via the RDT's `GatewayModule`) | "Transaction committed" notification |
| **Transaction explorers** (Radix Dashboard, closed source; community explorers) | Cannot be verified for the Dashboard; from its features, practically the whole API, including the **resource holders** extension, NFT location, filtered history of **any** entity, validator uptime, KV stores, packages, schemas and `at_ledger_state` | See section [2.1](#s2-1) |
| **Developer Console** (closed source) | Cannot be verified; from its features, at least preview, submit, status and entity details | Package deployment, manifests |
| **Consultation** (governance) | `state/entity/details`, `state/key-value-store/{keys, data}`, `stream/transactions`, `transaction/committed-details`, `status/gateway-status`, balances and NFTs **with historical `at_ledger_state`** | Proposals, votes, snapshot tally |
| **radixdlt-rust-sdk** | `status/gateway-status`, `state/entity/page/fungibles`, `transaction/{status, committed-details, submit, construction, preview}`, `state/entity/details` | Generic signing and submission SDK |
| **wallet-agent-ai** | ~25 calls: entity details, preview, submit, status, stream, validators, uptime | Agent with its own wallet |
| **Exchanges and integrators** | According to the Core API specification, they are recommended to use the node's own `/lts/` endpoints (`core-api-schema.yaml:83-89`, v1.4.0.0) | Deposits, withdrawals and transaction tracking. Those who follow that recommendation **do not depend on the Gateway**. Those using the Gateway or the Mesh API (removed in v1.4.0.0) must move to the LTS. |
| **Radix-Desktop-Tool** | The whole API, via `@atlantis-l/radix-tool` | Desktop tooling, history |

## 2.1 Transaction explorers: an explicit requirement

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **Is it possible?** Yes. Explorers can work without the Gateway.
> - **Difficulty:** Medium.
> - **Effort and timeline:** ~1-2 person-months of indexes + ~2-3 for the reference explorer (estimate).

An explorer is the **most demanding** client: it needs global indexes that neither the node nor the wallets need. Each explorer feature has a different source: the node itself or a new index.

| Explorer feature | How it is served without the Gateway |
|---|---|
| Look up a transaction by intent hash: receipt, events, state changes, fees | Yes, in the node: `/core/transaction/receipt` (by `intent_hash`) and `/core/lts/transaction/status`. Balance changes are computed from the receipt. |
| Latest transactions; transactions by epoch or round | Yes, in the node: `/core/stream/transactions` (ascending). Descending order or "from a date" needs a `timestamp → state_version` index. |
| Account, component or resource page: current state, balances, NFTs, metadata, roles, royalties | Yes, in the node: Core and Engine State APIs |
| Packages: blueprints, code, schemas | Yes, in the node: `/core/state/package`, `/blueprint/info`, `/entity/schema/entry` |
| Component KV stores | Yes, in the node: `/kv-store/iterator` |
| **Transaction history of any entity**, filtered by type, resource or event | No: E3 index (a), or N3 |
| **Holders of a resource**, ranked by balance | No: new index (h): `resource → (entity, balance)` |
| **Where an NFT is** | No: E3 index (b), or N2 |
| Validators: uptime, stake history, APY | No: E3 index (g), or N9. Current stake comes from the node. |
| Account or resource state at a past date | No: archive node (N5), or balance-change index (a) + (h) |
| Statistics: TPS, transactions per day, active accounts, fees burned | No: new index (i): hourly and daily aggregates |
| Search by name or symbol (metadata) | No: new index (j): text of `name`, `symbol`, `tags` → entity |
| Search by address | Yes: the address encodes its type; `/entity/info` is enough |

**Consequences for the strategy:**

- Explorers **rule out E1**. With the node alone, history, holders and statistics pages are lost.
- **E3 must include indexes (h), (i) and (j).** They remain small:
  - (h) scales with the number of resource-holder pairs, not with state versions;
  - (i) is a few rows per hour;
  - (j) covers only entities that have `name` or `symbol` metadata.
- **The official explorer (Radix Dashboard) is not open source.** For the network to have an explorer that depends on nobody, an **open-source reference explorer** is also needed. It would run against `radix-lite-indexer` or any access point discovered on ledger (section [7.16](07-per-repository-changes.md#s7-16)).

## 2.2 The Olympia legacy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **Is it possible?** Yes. Olympia does not prevent removing the Gateway. Archiving its history is also possible.
> - **Difficulty:** Low.
> - **Effort and timeline:** weeks for the archive (estimate); it is urgent, because it must be done before the Olympia Gateway is switched off.

> [!NOTE]
> **Status (8 Nov 2026):** the archive exists. Olympia's full history is published on Hugging Face and archive.org under CC0, verified against the official Olympia Gateway and against the Babylon genesis, and it works in an explorer that shows both eras. Details in the [F0.1 progress report](progress-f0-1-olympia-archive-and-explorer.md).

Radix had an earlier network, **Olympia**, which was migrated to Babylon on 28 Sep 2023. This was checked against the live ledger and the code: it **does not block the solution**, but it adds four considerations, three of which require work (items 1, 3 and 4).

1. **Olympia's state is inside the Babylon genesis.**
   - Mainnet state versions 1 to 647 are genesis transactions (648-669 are already round updates). The first user transaction is version 670 (2023-09-28 07:26 UTC).
   - Those transactions load, in chunks (`GenesisDataChunk`: `Validators`, `Stakes`, `Resources`, `ResourceBalances`, `XrdBalances`; `radix-engine/.../genesis_helper/src/lib.rs:34-46`), the validators, stakes, tokens and balances that existed on Olympia. Accounts are derived from the Olympia secp256k1 keys.
   - **Consequence for the indexer (E3/E2):**
     - the first sync must start at version 1 and process genesis, whose receipts are very large;
     - otherwise every migrated account that has not moved since 2023 would be missing from the indexes: XRD holders, the account's first movement, migrated stakes.
   - This is a one-off job and can be included in the signed snapshots.
2. **Olympia accounts keep working without the Gateway.**
   - Importing Olympia accounts into the Babylon wallet is **offline**: export with `olympia-wallet`, and `MigrateOlympiaAccountsUseCase` in the Android wallet.
   - ROLA accepts address derivation for accounts without `owner_keys`, including Olympia's secp256k1 ones, although it always queries the ledger to check this (section [7.9](07-per-repository-changes.md#s7-9)).
   - The **recovery scan** with an Olympia seed phrase (BIP44 path, `ResolveDerivationPathsForRecoveryScanUseCase.kt:42-79`) uses the same ledger queries as everything else. It works against a node: genesis-created accounts exist and are detected with `/entity/info`, even without `last_updated_at_state_version`.
3. **Olympia transaction history (before 28 Sep 2023) is not in the Babylon ledger.**
   - It is served only by the **Olympia Gateway**, `olympia-gateway.radixdlt.com`. It is still live today, running Gateway API 1.1.14, frozen at version 337,759,839 from 2023-09-28T06:33:34Z.
   - It is used by `olympia-wallet` (`src/helpers/network.ts:14-39`) and the Olympia explorer (`radixdlt/explorer`).
   - It is **another central service**, and it does not appear in the transition service lists published by the Foundation that were reviewed.
   - If it is switched off, Olympia's public history (audits, taxes, research) **is lost**, unless someone keeps a copy of an Olympia node or Gateway database.
   - **Advantage:** it is frozen and no longer changes, so it needs no indexer. A **single, verifiable archive** is enough:
     - export the Olympia ledger (node database or a dump of the Olympia Gateway);
     - publish it with its hash on distributed storage (IPFS, BitTorrent or Arweave);
     - add a static index by `rdx1…` address that any explorer can serve as plain files.
   - **Priority P0, because it is urgent:** this must be done before the Foundation's infrastructure is switched off.
   - **Status (8 Nov 2026):** done. The Olympia Gateway is still online, but its history no longer depends on it: a public, verified copy exists ([F0.1 report](progress-f0-1-olympia-archive-and-explorer.md)).
4. **Explorers must understand both eras.**
   - An Olympia address (`rdx1…`) maps deterministically to its Babylon account (`account_rdx…`), because both come from the same key. Sargon already does this conversion, so no index is needed.
   - **The reverse is not direct:** a Babylon account is a hash of the key, so `rdx1…` cannot simply be derived from `account_rdx…`. It needs an index (the archive includes `accounts_by_babylon_address`) or recovering the key from one of the account's signatures on Babylon, which only exists once it has signed a transaction.
   - The reference explorer ([7.16](07-per-repository-changes.md#s7-16)) should accept both addresses, showing Olympia history from the static archive and Babylon history from the nodes.
   - **Status (8 Nov 2026):** the Radix Community explorer already does this, reading the static archive directly, with no data server of its own ([F0.1 report](progress-f0-1-olympia-archive-and-explorer.md)).
