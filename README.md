# Radix without central dependencies

English · [Español](README.es.md)

Technical analysis and roadmap for the Radix network to serve all of its users **without depending on the Babylon Gateway**, with **lighter nodes (target: 4-8 GB RAM and 500 GB disk or less)**, and with the **three possible final stages** of Layer 1: keep improving Babylon, migrate to Hyperscale or shard Babylon while keeping Scrypto. It includes code analysis, measured mainnet data, compared strategies, per-repository changes, an implementation guide and references from other networks.

Report dated 3 November 2026.

## Goals

1. **Remove the Gateway completely**, so that wallets, dApps, ROLA sign-in, explorers and tools work with the network's nodes (and their light indexer), without any central service.
2. **Network access that depends on no one:** many independent operators, discovered on ledger and, in the long term, without trusting any node (verifiable reads).
3. **Lighter nodes:** 4-8 GB of RAM and 500 GB of disk or less, so that more people can run them.
4. **Everything on Layer 1**, without Layer-2 solutions.
5. **Preserve history** of Olympia and Babylon in a verifiable way, without depending on a single operator.
6. **Prepare the final evolution of Layer 1**: keep improving Babylon, migrate to Hyperscale or shard Babylon while keeping Scrypto, as the community decides.

## Executive summary

1. **The Gateway is currently a single point of failure for the ecosystem.**
   - No official client talks to nodes directly: not the wallets (Sargon), the RDT, ROLA, the Connector Extension or the Dashboard.
   - According to the Foundation, its operation is **funded only until 31 December 2026**, and there is no public plan for afterwards.
2. **Nodes already handle the most common operations directly** (submitting transactions, checking their status, balances, NFTs, metadata, validators), according to the `babylon-node` code: of the 19 capabilities in the table in section [3.2](docs/en/03-what-the-node-offers.md#s3-2), 9 are fully covered and 2 partly. Six main functions are missing, fully or partly (N1-N6, chapter [3](docs/en/03-what-the-node-offers.md#s3)): pre-authorisation status, the location of an NFT, full history, lookup by access rules, historical state and safe public access.
3. **Six strategies were compared.** Based on the measured data, the most suitable combines two (E3 and E2), with E6 (keeping specific applications' data on ledger, such as votes) as a complement:
   - **Short term (E3): a light indexer next to each node**, which replaces the Gateway. The Gateway ceases to exist.
     - So that already-released wallets and dApps keep working without an update, the indexer accepts the same requests those applications send today. Only the **API format (requests and responses)** is kept, not the Gateway software.
     - It would add **about 10-50 GB** of indexes (estimate) to a full node, which today takes ~493-600 GB according to a measurement contributed by Daffy, a community member. The Gateway adds **~2.5 TB** to that same node. The cost is almost nil for anyone who already runs a node.
     - A **public** read node needs more resources than a personal one, depending on the traffic it serves. This is handled with batch reads in the node, a cache in the indexer and many read nodes instead of one (section [6.4](docs/en/06-recommended-solution.md#s6-4)).
     - It includes what **transaction explorers** need, and is complemented by an **open-source reference explorer**.
     - **History without a central service:** nodes export their history in verifiable segments, with the validators' proofs inside, before pruning it, and those segments are replicated across stores run by different operators (section [6.5](docs/en/06-recommended-solution.md#s6-5), based on a design contributed by Daffy, a community member).
   - **Medium term (E2): build those indexes and a public read mode into the node itself.** Every node in the network becomes an access point.
   - **On-ledger discovery:** applications get the list of access points from validator metadata instead of using a fixed address.
4. **Lighter nodes (chapter [9](docs/en/09-lighter-nodes.md#s9)).**
   - Today a mainnet node reserves 12 GB of memory for Java, runs RocksDB with no memory limits and keeps the full history; the compressed ledger is already 274 GiB.
   - With specific code changes (tuning RocksDB, pruning data used only by APIs, bootstrapping from a verified snapshot and, later, migrating the core from Java to Rust), a validator or full node **could run with at most 8 GB of RAM, and plausibly 4 GB, with 500 GB of disk or less** (estimates to be confirmed by measuring a real node). A mainnet node already takes ~493 GB without the account change index and ~600 GB with it, which is enabled by default, and grows ~65 GB a year (measurement contributed by Daffy, a community member). Staying under 500 GB requires the disk changes R3-R8.
5. **Possible final stages (chapters [11](docs/en/11-hyperscale-evolution.md#s11) and [13](docs/en/13-xian-with-scrypto.md#s13)).** Governance will choose between keeping improving Babylon (FINAL A), migrating to Hyperscale (FINAL B) or sharding Babylon while keeping Scrypto (FINAL C). On Hyperscale:
   - Hyperscale is open source, but it is **a new network**: a different virtual machine, different addresses and no Scrypto compatibility. Adopting it means migrating balances and **rewriting applications**.
   - The work would fall to the community. The recommended strategy is a genesis with **verifiable claims** of balances using cryptographic proofs.
   - Its difficulty is **very high**, with an estimated 2-4 year timeline. Meanwhile, Babylon must keep running, so the rest of the plan remains useful.
   - **Alternative (chapter [13](docs/en/13-xian-with-scrypto.md#s13)): Xi'an with Scrypto.** Babylon can evolve on its own ledger into a sharded network with atomic composability, **keeping Scrypto, dApps and balances**. It requires each transaction to declare the global entities it uses, reorganising state and building a new sharded consensus. Difficulty **very high**, ~150-280 person-months and 3-5 years (estimate). The final capacity, including the one-million-transactions-per-second target, is not proven and must be measured.
6. **References from other networks (chapter [12](docs/en/12-references-other-networks.md#s12)).** Cardano, Sui, Aptos, Solana, NEAR, Polkadot, Kaspa, Ethereum and Cosmos already use techniques equivalent to the proposals (verified snapshots, pruning, reads in the node, light clients, rewriting in Rust), which confirms they are feasible. How Midnight implements privacy is also analysed, as a reference for Radix's Layer 1.

The "Conclusion" section below summarises feasibility and difficulty for each goal. Section [9.4](docs/en/09-lighter-nodes.md#s9-4) details each node change, chapter [10](docs/en/10-implementation-guide.md#s10) explains step by step how to build the main pieces, and the [glossary](docs/en/glossary.md) explains technical terms.

## Conclusion

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **Is it possible?** Yes. The network can serve all of its users and use cases without the Gateway.
> - **Difficulty:** Medium-high (organisation and timeline more than technology).
> - **Effort and timeline:** 7-12 person-months for the minimum viable solution, within months; 21-35 for the full one, during 2027 (estimates).

**Can the Radix network serve all of its users and use cases without depending on the Gateway?** **Yes.**

- No use case needs information that only the Gateway can produce: everything comes from the ledger and the state that nodes already store.
- What is missing is specific indexes and a public access mode on nodes. No protocol or consensus changes are needed.
- Everything is solved on Layer 1, without Layer-2 solutions (see "[Design principle](docs/en/01-02-current-situation.md#scope)" in the Scope).

**Olympia is not an obstacle.** Its state was migrated into the Babylon genesis, so nodes already have it. It adds three tasks (section [2.2](docs/en/01-02-current-situation.md#s2-2) describes four considerations; only the second requires no work):

- processing genesis once when building the indexes;
- **archiving Olympia's history as soon as possible**, because it is not in Babylon and depended on a single service. This task is **low** difficulty but **urgent**. **Done in November 2026** ([F0.1](docs/en/progress-f0-1-olympia-archive-and-explorer.md)).
- explorers accepting both address types (Olympia and Babylon) and showing each history from its source. The Radix Community explorer already does it ([F0.1](docs/en/progress-f0-1-olympia-archive-and-explorer.md)).

**Feasibility and difficulty by goal:**

| Goal | Is it possible? | Difficulty | Estimated effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| dApps, ROLA sign-in, transaction submission and tracking, balances | **Yes** | **Low-medium** | ~1-2 person-months (in the RDT and ROLA: `NodeGatewayApiService`, `ownerKeysReader` and `relayUrl`, sections [7.8](docs/en/07-per-repository-changes.md#s7-8) and [7.9](docs/en/07-per-repository-changes.md#s7-9)) |
| Current wallets working without the Gateway (E3, no new releases) | **Yes** | **Medium** | ~4-7 person-months for the light indexer |
| Full transaction explorers without the Gateway (dedicated indexes and an open-source reference explorer) | **Yes** | **Medium** | ~1-2 person-months of indexes + ~2-3 for the explorer |
| Effective decentralisation: many operators, on-ledger discovery, failover and resubmission in clients | **Yes** | **Medium** | ~3-5 person-months in clients (Sargon, wallets, extension and SDK; excluding the RDT and ROLA) |
| All features inside the node itself (E2), full history and governance snapshots | **Yes** | **High** | ~6-10 person-months in the node + ~4-6 in clients |
| Verifiable archive of Olympia's history | **Yes**: done in Nov 2026 ([F0.1](docs/en/progress-f0-1-olympia-archive-and-explorer.md)) | **Low** | Weeks |
| Full history without depending on one operator: export, then prune, with replicated verifiable segments (section [6.5](docs/en/06-recommended-solution.md#s6-5)) | **Yes** | **Medium** | ~5-9 person-months |
| Nodes with 4-8 GB RAM and ≤ 500 GB disk, still on Java (R1-R9, chapter [9](docs/en/09-lighter-nodes.md#s9)) | **Yes** (estimate: 8 GB achievable, 4 GB plausible; public read nodes are sized to their traffic, section [6.4](docs/en/06-recommended-solution.md#s6-4)) | **Medium** | ~8-14 person-months |
| Migrating the node core from Java to Rust (R11): enough headroom in 4 GB, including for low-traffic read nodes | **Yes** | **Very high** | ~30-50 person-months |
| Access without trusting the node: verifiable reads with a light client (section [6.2](docs/en/06-recommended-solution.md#s6-2)) | **Yes** | **Very high** | ~40-80 person-months, several years |
| Keep improving Babylon on its own ledger as the final stage (FINAL A: R1-R11) | **Yes** | **Medium to very high** (R11) | ~40-65 person-months, 1-3 years |
| Migration to Hyperscale as the final stage (FINAL B, chapter [11](docs/en/11-hyperscale-evolution.md#s11)) | **Yes, with conditions**: the network and funds yes; dApps must be rewritten; not yet production-ready | **Very high** | ~110-210 person-months, 2-4 years, excluding dApps |
| Keeping Scrypto contracts on Hyperscale (section [11.4](docs/en/11-hyperscale-evolution.md#s11-4)) | **No** with Hyperscale's current design | **Very high** if attempted (fork) | Not recommended |
| A sharded network with atomicity keeping Scrypto, without migrating to Hyperscale (Xi'an with Scrypto, chapter [13](docs/en/13-xian-with-scrypto.md#s13)) | **Yes, with conditions**: per-global-entity access list and deterministic abort; capacity to be measured | **Very high** | ~150-280 person-months, 3-5 years |

### What to do for each goal: best strategy and technology

This is a technical table: the names of technologies from other networks (Geyser, smoldot, Helios, Leios…) are explained in chapter [12](docs/en/12-references-other-networks.md#s12), and the sharding ones (Cerberus, OLLP, Pilotfish) in chapter [13](docs/en/13-xian-with-scrypto.md#s13).

| Goal | What has to be done | Best strategy or technology | Why | Details |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Remove the Gateway before its funding ends** | Build and deploy the light indexer next to nodes, with the API format apps already use; conformance tests while the Gateway is still running | **A Rust light indexer next to the node (E3)**, fed by the node's transaction stream, in the style of Geyser (Solana) or Aptos's stream service | It works with current wallets without new releases; it adds ~10-50 GB (estimate) to the node, versus the ~2.5 TB the Gateway adds | [6](docs/en/06-recommended-solution.md#s6), [7.1](docs/en/07-per-repository-changes.md#s7-1), [10.1](docs/en/10-implementation-guide.md#s10-1) |
| **Network access that depends on no one** | Many read-node operators; clients find them and fail over between them | **An access-point registry on Layer 1 itself** (validator metadata), plus a bootstrap list and failover in clients, like Kaspa's *Resolver* | Existing federated networks (Koios, Kaspa) coordinate off chain; doing it on Layer 1 removes that dependency too | [10.2](docs/en/10-implementation-guide.md#s10-2) |
| **Explorers without the Gateway** | Holder, statistics and search indexes; an open-source explorer | **The light indexer's indexes h, i and j + a static explorer** publishable on any hosting or IPFS | It depends on no server of its own; the official Dashboard is not open source | [2.1](docs/en/01-02-current-situation.md#s2-1), [7.16](docs/en/07-per-repository-changes.md#s7-16) |
| **Preserve Olympia's history** | Export it once and publish it | **A verifiable archive** (Merkle root signed by several people) on IPFS, BitTorrent or Arweave | It is frozen: it needs no indexer, only preservation | [2.2](docs/en/01-02-current-situation.md#s2-2), [10.5](docs/en/10-implementation-guide.md#s10-5) |
| **Preserve Babylon's history without a central service** | Export history before pruning it and replicate it | **Canonical per-epoch segments with the signed proofs inside, the export-then-prune rule and public replicas** (S3 run by several operators, IPFS, Arweave), based on a design contributed by the community | Nodes can prune without losing history, and nobody is indispensable to keep it | [6.5](docs/en/06-recommended-solution.md#s6-5), [10.8](docs/en/10-implementation-guide.md#s10-8) |
| **Build reads into the node itself** | Optional indexes and a public read mode in `babylon-node` | **A native read API in the node (E2)**, like Kaspa (wRPC) or Sui (gRPC in the full node) | Every node becomes an access point, with no separate process | [7.2](docs/en/07-per-repository-changes.md#s7-2), [10.3](docs/en/10-implementation-guide.md#s10-3) |
| **Reduce RAM to 8 GB or less (and probably to 4 GB)** | Cap RocksDB memory, reduce the Java heap and the mempool | **R1 + R2:** shared block cache, index and filter blocks inside the cache and a Write Buffer Manager, per the official RocksDB documentation; a 4 GB installer profile | Radix's state is already on disk; current consumption comes from configuration | [9.2](docs/en/09-lighter-nodes.md#s9-2), [9.4](docs/en/09-lighter-nodes.md#s9-4) |
| **Keep disk under 500 GB** | Stop storing what only APIs use; prune history on nodes that do not need it | **R3-R7 and pruned nodes (R8)**, with separate archive nodes, like the default pruning of Polkadot, Kaspa or Cosmos and Ethereum's history expiry | A mainnet node already takes ~493 GB (measurement contributed by Daffy, a community member); ~97-98 % of state versions are round updates, and most of their data is used only by APIs | [9.3](docs/en/09-lighter-nodes.md#s9-3), [9.4](docs/en/09-lighter-nodes.md#s9-4), [9.6](docs/en/09-lighter-nodes.md#s9-6) |
| **Serve public reads with commodity-hardware nodes** | Read several entities at once, cache responses and spread traffic | **Batch reads in the node (N7), an indexer cache invalidated by `state_version` and many read nodes discovered on ledger**, with a load test before committing to figures | The node reads one entity per call today, and the Gateway format aggregates up to 20 entities per request | [6.4](docs/en/06-recommended-solution.md#s6-4) |
| **Bootstrap new nodes in hours without trusting third parties** | Export and import state, verifying it against the signed root | **A verified end-of-epoch snapshot (R9)**, like Sui's formal snapshots or Polkadot's warp sync | Babylon already signs `state_tree_hash` in its proofs; it is the standard technique in modern networks | [9.4](docs/en/09-lighter-nodes.md#s9-4) (R9), [12.9](docs/en/12-references-other-networks.md#s12-9) |
| **Comfortable headroom in 4 GB and a simpler node** | Replace the Java part of the node with Rust | **A phased migration coexisting on the network (R11)**, as Kaspa did moving from Go to Rust | It removes the JVM and the JNI bridge; risk is contained by gradual adoption | [9.4](docs/en/09-lighter-nodes.md#s9-4) (R11) |
| **Not having to trust any node** | A Merkle-proof endpoint in the node and a light client in wallets and browsers | **Verifiable reads with a Rust light client compiled to WebAssembly**, like smoldot (Polkadot) or Helios (Ethereum) | It is the strongest guarantee: the wallet checks every response | [6.2](docs/en/06-recommended-solution.md#s6-2), [10.6](docs/en/10-implementation-guide.md#s10-6) |
| **Final evolution with Hyperscale** | Prepare Hyperscale for mainnet, read API, wallets, balance migration and dApp rewrites | **Genesis with verifiable claims (M1)**: a Merkle proof against Babylon's final root plus a signature, with a long window and support for securified accounts, combining the `MerkleDistributor` contract and Midnight's Glacier Drop | It requires no trust in a bridge and leaves no one out; first, compare with improving Babylon on its own chain, as Cardano does with Leios | [11](docs/en/11-hyperscale-evolution.md#s11), [12.1](docs/en/12-references-other-networks.md#s12-1), [12.8](docs/en/12-references-other-networks.md#s12-8) |
| **Scrypto contracts on Hyperscale** | Rewrite them with the Hyperscale SDK | **Rewriting assisted by translation tools**, taking advantage of both using Rust and similar concepts | Keeping Scrypto is not possible with Hyperscale's current design | [11.4](docs/en/11-hyperscale-evolution.md#s11-4) |
| **Shard Babylon while keeping Scrypto** (alternative) | Access list in transactions, state grouped by global entity, sharded consensus with a coordinating chain | **Reconnaissance and deterministic retry** (Calvin's OLLP, Sui's Pilotfish) + **atomic commitment across shards** (Cerberus, provisioning with Merkle proofs as in Hyperscale) | Keeps dApps, addresses and balances with no new network; it is the original Xi'an plan | Chapter [13](docs/en/13-xian-with-scrypto.md#s13) |
| **Privacy on Layer 1** (optional) | ZK proof verification in the engine and shielded resources | **A native ZK proof-verification primitive** in the Radix Engine (for example Halo2, like Midnight) and shielded resources | It keeps the Layer-1 principle, without a separate network | [12.8](docs/en/12-references-other-networks.md#s12-8) |

**Overall difficulty of removing the Gateway: medium-high.** The main difficulty is organisational rather than technical:

- **Coordination:** the Foundation is in maintenance mode. Changes to the node, Sargon and the wallets depend on community developers and governance (DAO / RAC).
- **Timeline:** Gateway funding ends on 31 December 2026.
- **Funding:** a small team would need roughly **7-12 person-months** for the minimum viable solution (light indexer, explorer indexes and reference explorer), and **21-35** to remove the Gateway with every feature (the sum of the first five rows of the table).

**Recommended short-term solution:** the **light indexer next to each node (E3)**, which replaces the Gateway, followed by integrating it into `babylon-node` (E2) and on-ledger discovery. The measured data supports it:

- it adds ~10-50 GB (estimate) to a ~493-600 GB full node (contributed measurement), versus the ~2.5 TB the Gateway adds;
- its cost per operator is close to zero (estimate), versus the ~€300-400/month a community proposal estimated for running the Gateway (section [1.1](docs/en/01-02-current-situation.md#s1-1));
- it works with current wallets without new releases;
- it is the only option that can be ready before funding ends.

**Is it possible?** Yes. **Difficulty:** medium.

**4-8 GB / 500 GB nodes** (chapter [9](docs/en/09-lighter-nodes.md#s9)). **Is it possible?** Yes: with R1-R2, a node of at most 8 GB looks achievable, and 4 GB is plausible (estimates to be measured). Radix is better placed than other networks because its state is already on disk, its validator set is small and its load is low (section [12.9](docs/en/12-references-other-networks.md#s12-9)). **Difficulty:** medium while on Java (R1-R9); very high for comfortable headroom (R11).

- **R1-R2:** remove the main cause of today's 16 GB (unbounded RocksDB and 12 GB reserved for Java); **R3-R4** reduce disk. All four are low cost (weeks). **Difficulty: low.**
- **R5-R9:** pruning and bootstrapping from a verified snapshot keep disk under 500 GB even as the network grows. **Difficulty: low-medium to medium** (R9, medium-high).
- **Read nodes:** they support R4-R6 and dropping the account change index. They can prune (R8) only if old history is served from exported segments (section [6.5](docs/en/06-recommended-solution.md#s6-5)). Section [9.6](docs/en/09-lighter-nodes.md#s9-6) sets out which change applies to each node type, and 6.4 how to handle read load.
- **R11:** migrating to Rust provides enough headroom for low-traffic read nodes to run in 4 GB as well. Public ones are sized with a load test (section [6.4](docs/en/06-recommended-solution.md#s6-4)). **Difficulty: very high.**

**Ideal long-term solution.** **Is it possible?** Yes. **Difficulty:** very high. Any node serves **verifiable** reads, and every wallet includes a light client that checks each response (section [6.2](docs/en/06-recommended-solution.md#s6-2)). Then no node needs to be trusted.

- Babylon already signs the Merkle roots of state, transactions and receipts; what is missing is exposing those proofs and verifying them in clients.
- It is the end goal within Babylon. Its difficulty is **very high** (several years), and the short-term solution is its first stage.

**Final evolution with Hyperscale** (chapter [11](docs/en/11-hyperscale-evolution.md#s11)). **Is it possible?** Yes, with conditions. **Difficulty:** very high.

- **Is it possible to migrate Radix using the Hyperscale code? Yes, with conditions.** The network and funds can migrate; Scrypto contracts and dApps cannot, because they must be rewritten. With the current code, still in development, it is not yet possible in production.
- **Can Scrypto be kept with Hyperscale?** Not with the current design: Hyperscale lists Scrypto compatibility as a non-goal. The Hyperscale SDK also uses Rust and `#[blueprint]` and has similar concepts (resources, badges, virtual accounts), which makes rewriting contracts easier, but they do have to be rewritten (section [11.4](docs/en/11-hyperscale-evolution.md#s11-4)).
- It is a migration to a new network, not an upgrade.
- The community would have to:
  - prepare Hyperscale for mainnet;
  - build its read API and indexer;
  - adapt Sargon and the wallets;
  - migrate balances through verifiable claims;
  - and each project would have to rewrite its contracts.
- The pieces proposed in this report (light indexer, on-ledger discovery, verified snapshots, Merkle proofs and the `LedgerBackend` interface) are also needed for that migration.
- Recommendation: governance should choose between the three final stages (FINAL A, B or C) with the data from stage C0 (section [13.10](docs/en/13-xian-with-scrypto.md#s13-10)). Until then, apply R1-R9 and **postpone R11**.

**Alternative final stage: Xi'an with Scrypto** (chapter [13](docs/en/13-xian-with-scrypto.md#s13)). **Is it possible?** Yes, with conditions. **Difficulty:** very high. **Effort:** ~150-280 person-months and 3-5 years (estimate).

- Babylon would evolve **on its own ledger**, through protocol updates, into a sharded network with atomic composability, **keeping Scrypto, dApps, addresses and balances**.
- It requires three large changes: each transaction declares the global entities it uses (with a deterministic abort if it touches another), state is grouped by global entity, and a new sharded consensus is built in Rust, replacing R11.
- Reusing Hyperscale's consensus is not easy, because it is tied to its virtual machine; its networking and signature libraries are reused, and its designs serve as references.
- The final capacity, including the one-million-transactions-per-second target, is **not proven** for contracts like Scrypto and must be measured.
- Recommendation: do stage C0 first, which measures on real mainnet history how many transactions would touch several shards. It is cheap and helps decide between FINAL A, B and C.

**Still to validate with a prototype:**

- the real size of the indexes;
- indexing speed from genesis;
- exact compatibility of responses with what wallets expect;
- the real per-table ledger size on a mainnet node.

### Final stage A: what would happen if Babylon keeps improving

**Is it possible?** Yes. **Difficulty:** medium while on Java (R1-R9); very high for the Rust node (R11). Everything is kept, but the network still has a single shard: capacity improves through optimisation, not horizontal scaling. Green: kept; yellow: no fundamental change.

    class B7,A7 partial
```

### Final stage B: what would move from Babylon to Hyperscale

**Is it possible?** Yes, with conditions: the network and funds can migrate with strategy M1 (genesis and verifiable claims), although with the current Hyperscale code, still in development, it is not yet possible in production. **Difficulty:** very high. **Scrypto is not compatible:** contracts and dApps would have to be rewritten. Green: moves directly; yellow: moves with changes; red: does not move.

```

### Final stage C: what would happen with Xi'an with Scrypto

**Is it possible?** Yes, with conditions: each transaction declares the global entities it uses, state is reorganised and a new sharded consensus must be built. **Difficulty:** very high. **Scrypto is kept**, but the final capacity is not proven and must be measured (stage C0). Green: kept as is; yellow: kept with changes or still to be proven.

## Final reflection

**The question is no longer whether it is possible.** The analysis shows that every goal is technically feasible, and that the most urgent work (removing the Gateway and lightening nodes) does not require changing consensus. The real question is a different one: **does Radix have developers with the necessary capability, and a community committed enough, to carry it out?**

The report's data makes it possible to state what each side requires:

- **Technical capability.**
  - The most urgent work (light indexer and node tuning) needs Rust and database profiles, with bounded effort: 7-12 person-months for the minimum viable solution.
  - The most ambitious work (moving consensus to Rust, verifiable reads, Hyperscale) needs consensus and cryptography specialists, who are scarce in the ecosystem today:
    - `hyperscale-rs` depends almost entirely on a single developer;
    - according to the Foundation itself, its in-house team works with around 10 % of the resources it had before its restructuring ([2026 Strategy](https://www.radixdlt.com/blog/2026-strategy-the-next-chapter-of-radix)).
- **Community commitment.** It requires:
  - operators who run read and archive nodes;
  - funding decided by governance;
  - timely decisions, before 31 Dec 2026;
  - and contributions such as those this repository enables.

  There are signs in both directions:
  - **in favour:** the community has run Stokenet since June 2026 (according to [radix.wiki](https://radix.wiki/ecosystem/radix-accountability-council), a secondary source), and XRD holder consultations have drawn over one billion XRD ([Foundation Update](https://www.radixdlt.com/blog/foundation-update-moving-to-maintenance-mode));
  - **against:** of the six milestones proposed for `hyperscale-rs`, only the first was funded, because the DAO treasury was not yet available (according to [radix.wiki](https://radix.wiki/contents/tech/releases/radix-mainnet-xian), a secondary source; [original RFC](https://radixtalk.com/t/rfc-xian-delivering-hyperscale-for-radix/2280)).
- **Precedents.** Other communities have done it: Kaspa rewrote its node in Rust, and the Cardano community maintains Koios with independent operators (chapter [12](docs/en/12-references-other-networks.md#s12)).

**Technology is not the obstacle.** The outcome will depend on whether the Radix community decides to prioritise this work, gathers the necessary talent and funds it in time. This report aims to make that decision easier, and is itself an invitation to contribute.

## How to contribute

This repository is open source and the community can improve it through issues and pull requests:

- **Corrections** to figures, references, links or translations.
- Real **data and measurements** (ledger size, RAM, sync times), with method and date.
- **New strategies** or alternatives to the report's proposals.
- **Community ideas and notes** in the [`community/`](community/README.md) folder.
- **Links to prototypes** or implementations that advance a proposal.

The [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) explains how, and the quality rules: always cite sources, mark estimates and keep both languages in sync.

> Figures marked as *estimate* must be validated with a prototype or a real measurement.
